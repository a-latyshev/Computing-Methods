# Computing-Methods
Computing labs for 6 semestr
This program solves a Dirichlet problem and finds eigenvalues of Laplace operator.
There is five-point difference scheme in two-dimensional space
Lyusternik_m_square and Lyusternik_m_house - realization of Lyusternik's method for finding of eigenvalues
for square and my special "house" domains respectively
Relaxation_m_square Relaxation_m_house- realization of solving the task via relaxation methods
and others
YOU NEED additional library: Armadillo C++ linear algebra library http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html
